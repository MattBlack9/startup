Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has been growing rapidly in the most recent years. This is due to the rise of tournaments, exciting new jiujitsueiros, and more competitive gyms throughout the nation. With this, there is a lot of possibility to connect people while also make money in the process. This is why an app on the phone would be the perfect thing. This is a way to track each workout, or roll. Track when you got your stipes and belts. How many submissions you had that week and which one is your favorite. With this app, one could connect other practitioners of the martial art through chats as well. There is currently nothing like it on the market and endless possibilities.

Key Features:
Accounts and secure login
Workout tracking
Chatting with friends
Creative visual display

This is my website that I created with my own server. Something that I learned with this part of the course was just how cool and easy it was to create my own website and server. It is also really cheap! This makes me want to create more of them and do more things. This honestly has been so eye opening and moving for me that I know what I want to do with my life. I want to dive deep into all of this stuff. It is so cool that I can create my own server, website, and code to do whatever I want.
