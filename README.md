Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has been growing rapidly in the most recent years. This is due to the rise of tournaments, exciting new jiujitsueiros, and more competitive gyms throughout the nation. With this, there is a lot of possibility to connect people while also make money in the process. This is why an app on the phone would be the perfect thing. This is a way to track each workout, or roll. Track when you got your stipes and belts. How many submissions you had that week and which one is your favorite. With this app, one could connect other practitioners of the martial art through chats as well. There is currently nothing like it on the market and endless possibilities.

Key Features:
Accounts and secure login
Workout tracking
Chatting with friends
Creative visual display

This is my website that I created with my own server. Something that I learned with this part of the course was just how cool and easy it was to create my own website and server. It is also really cheap! This makes me want to create more of them and do more things. This honestly has been so eye opening and moving for me that I know what I want to do with my life. I want to dive deep into all of this stuff. It is so cool that I can create my own server, website, and code to do whatever I want.

Something that I found really interesting was how you could re-route some address to another IP via paying more. This is something that I never knew, but I definitely see the benefit of doing so. This is an amazing class and I love how much I am already learning from it. 

Something that I learned with this assignment was really how to use vim. This is something that I was forced to use because I needed to edit something directly with vim in order to secure my website. I now know that I need to get better at using this feature as I will most definitely be needing to know how to use this in the future. 

Something that I found interesting was that the HTML language was no so difficult to understand. I feel like with C++ and other languages like Python and stuff there is a steep learning curve as to knowing how to do stuff. With HTML, there is simple syntax that is easy to understand and the same across multiple functions, that it as much as I have learned so far. 

Something that I found interesting was that HTML shows you where the structure ranks on the page. The indentation always increases with every new item. This is something that is helpful to me as I know that I would very easily get lost if I did not have those indentations in the code so that I could keep my thoughts straight. 

Something that I learned this lesson was that it was not nearly as hard as I thought to add these interactive inputs into a website. I did not know that they followed a simple pattern like the <p></p> way of doing things and this makes the task of having interactive things way less daunting. I loved the CodePen also because I got to see how the different things worked and were organized so that they made sense in my brain.
