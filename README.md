Changed my development from local environment and GitHub

Something that I learned throughout this assignment was how challenging using the terminal can really be. This is something that I really want to learn, but often overlooked. There were a lot of snags for me as my command line was not giving the same error messages from the homework description, but I was able to accomplish this assignment nonetheless. I am very pleased with the fact that I was able to do so and I look forward to doing more things with GitHub.
